# Overview
Hospitals violate parental autonomy by pressuring parents to immediately circumcise their baby without being fully informed of the consequences, even though circumcisions can be delayed to any age (even at 90-years-old).
# Cost-Effectiveness
About **$20** on average to save a baby from circumcision.
Studies have found that anywhere from 1% to 40% of individuals who receive a booklet will change their behavior.
Using the conservative 1% figure, at 7 cents per booklet, and with 70% of people becoming parents, it costs $20 on average to save a baby from circumcision.
# Evidence of Impact
Pending data from this campaign.
To set a precedent on putting data and research first, after this campaign strategy, we will monitor how many people visit and download from the website.
We will also do another fundraiser to fund an MTurk study to validate and measure the efficacy of these leaflets/stickers and identify which rhetoric works best for different demographics. From this, we can create several tailored leaflets/stickers that can be downloaded and distributed effectively.
